# Breakwater
Breakwater is a library for environmental procedural content generation and related tools.

The general idea is that I want to be able to create maps, rooms, weather phenomena, geological features, astronomical features, constellations, that sort of thing.  Natural and artificial locations.  Tides!  Moons!  Crap like that.

I don't know, I'm just making this up as I go.

## Planetary System

Generation of the Planetary System begins with a Host Star.  This is what we'll term the star at the center of this conjectured extrasolar system.  It's possible for the host star to be part of a binary system; in a non-circumbinary (S-type) planetary orbit, the planet will circle only one of the stars, whereas a circumbinary (P-type) planetary orbit features the planet circling both.  This could lead to very interesting worlds!
