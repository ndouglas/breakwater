# Breakwater
Breakwater is a library for environmental procedural content generation and related tools.

The general idea is that I want to be able to create maps, rooms, weather phenomena, geological features, astronomical features, constellations, that sort of thing.  Natural and artificial locations.  Tides!  Moons!  Crap like that.

I don't know, I'm just making this up as I go.
